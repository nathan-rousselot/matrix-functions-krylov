# Note On Matrix Functions

## Overview

This repository accompanies my note on matrix functions. It is home for implementations focusing on matrix functionsâ€”a critical component of numerical linear algebra with broad applications from solving ordinary and partial differential equations to control theory and machine learning. We extend the notion of scalar functions to act on matrices and tackle both theoretical and computational challenges involved in such extension. This work provides rigorous definitions, algorithmic approaches, and empirical validations for computing matrix functions.

## Introduction

This repository is structured around a comprehensive document that aims to:

1. Establish a formal mathematical foundation for matrix functions.
2. Explore the underlying spectral decomposition for evaluating differentiable matrix functions.
3. Address computational challenges, with a focus on the role of Krylov subspaces.
4. Validate theoretical claims through numerical experiments.

For more details, refer to the [document](./paper/matrix-functions.pdf).

## Features

1. **Rigorous Definitions**: Different approaches such as natural definition, spectrum-based definition, and interpolation-based definition are provided.
2. **Computational Efficiency**: Detailed examination of matrix-vector products and their efficient evaluation using Krylov subspaces.
3. **Algorithmic Stance**: Dense and sparse matrix algorithms, as well as two versions of Arnoldi Method.
4. **Numerical Experiments**: Code to reproduce the empirical validation of algorithmic choices and computational efficiency.
